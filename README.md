# My dotfiles
To keep dot config files organized and portable. Inspired by [Lars Kappert's post](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789).

I am using [solarized color scheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) for vim, designed by Ethan Schoonover.

.dircolors was taken [here](https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized).

## Install
My dotfiles are managed by GNU Stow - install it first.
```
sudo yum install stow
git clone repo dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```
